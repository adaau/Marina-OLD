#About
MARINA is a boat-sharing app to connect boat owners and boat renters.

The premise behind this "sharing economy" app is to create a marketplace for boats: owners seldom use their boats; renters don't have access to boats. By using the app, owners can monetize their boats during idle time while renters get access to a huge supply of boats.
